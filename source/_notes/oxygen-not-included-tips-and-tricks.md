Here are some random notes on the game "Oxygen Not Included".

# Generator Network

All generators and their smart batteries should be placed on the same network
without any transformer in between. All smart batteries in the network will 
gradually synchronize to the same charging level. Because of this, it is 
possible to prioritize different generators by setting the charing threshold
of smart batteries.

# Early Metal Refinery

If it is possible to dig down to oil biome at the bottom of the map through a
straight shaft, it is advisable to pump crude oil from the biome and feed it
to the early metal refinery as coolant. Exhaust should be sent to a liquid
vent over the shaft so that heated oil can drop back to the oil biome.

Rationale for this is that oil biome is already hot and there is no problem
making it even hotter.

# Later Metal Refinery

Metal refinery can heat crude oil coolant beyond 125 degree, so it can be 
used with steam turbine for cooling and energy recovery. Note that:

1. Pipes should be short, so the best placement is either placing steam 
turbine and metal refinery horizontally right next to each other above the 
steam chamber, or a vertical steam turbine/steam chamber/metal refinery stack.
2. Use ceramics for any pipes outside steam chamber to avoid heat loss.
3. Steel aquatuner is required for cooling the machinery. Even gold analgram
is not enough.

# Aquatuner Cooling Loop

When using an aquatuner in a cooling loop, output port of the aquatuner should
be the first output port in the pipe so it has the highest draining priority.
Not doing so can clog the aquatuner and break the system.
